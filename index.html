            <p>-Tyler Rohde</p>

            <p>My name is Tyler Rohde, and my goal is to revolutionize the design game and become <strong>one of the most well-renowned creatives of all time!</strong> Taking into consideration my creative experience besides graphic design, I like to create unique compositions with different techniques, and different mediums. </p>

            <p>My formal experience so far includes completing the SHSM program for Communication & Design during high school, working in a print shop for about a year, and now studying at Algonquin College for graphic design, where I'm currently a first-year student.</p>
